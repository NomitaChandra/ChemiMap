"6794356,Tricuspid valve regurgitation and lithium carbonate toxicity in a newborn infant.,""A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and a high serum lithium level is described. This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter, and the 11th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy. Sixty-three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement. Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy.

"227508,Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine.,""In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors.

"1378968,Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium-induced chronic renal failure in rats.,""Rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"",""['lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'lithium', 'Li', 'Lithium', 'creatinine', 'lithium', 'Li', 'Li']"",""['chronic renal failure', 'nephropathy', 'renal failure', 'proteinuria', 'hypertension', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'renal failure', 'nephropathy', 'proteinuria', 'hypertension', 'chronic renal failure']"",""['54', '111', '362', '520', '581', '608', '632', '820', '853', '941', '955', '1156', '1177', '1333', '1379']"",""['61', '118', '369', '527', '588', '615', '639', '827', '860', '943', '962', '1166', '1184', '1335', '1381']"",""['70', '127', '309', '975', '1000', '1027', '1087', '1390', '1466', '1500', '1531']"",""['91', '138', '322', '986', '1012', '1045', '1100', '1401', '1477', '1512', '1552']"",""['D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D003404', 'D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094']"",""['D007676', 'D007674', 'D051437', 'D011507', 'D006973', 'D005921', 'D051437', 'D007674', 'D011507', 'D006973', 'D007676']"",""['D008094', 'D008094', 'D008094']"",""['D006973', 'D011507', 'D007676']""";
"1420741,Treatment of Crohn's disease with fusidic acid: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin.,""Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin. Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight Crohn's disease patients were included. Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated."",""['fusidic acid', 'cyclosporin', 'cyclosporin', 'fusidic acid', 'Fusidic acid', 'fusidic acid', 'fusidic acid', 'fusidic acid']"",""[""""Crohn's disease"""", """"Crohn's disease"""", """"Crohn's disease"""", 'nausea', """"Crohn's disease"""", 'inflammatory bowel disease']"",""['34', '107', '217', '391', '507', '743', '1205', '1402']"",""['46', '118', '228', '403', '519', '755', '1217', '1414']"",""['13', '292', '467', '910', '1263', '1440']"",""['28', '307', '482', '916', '1278', '1466']"",""['D005672', 'D016572', 'D016572', 'D005672', 'D005672', 'D005672', 'D005672', 'D005672']"",""['D003424', 'D003424', 'D003424', 'D009325', 'D003424', 'D015212']"",['D005672'],['D009325']";
